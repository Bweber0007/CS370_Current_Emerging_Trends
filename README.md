# CS370_Current_Emerging_Trends
In this course, we discussed artificial intelligence and created a program utilizing reinforcement learning in the form a DQN.



## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

Both of the .py files were given as well as most of the .ipynb file. The section that I completed myself was part of the qtrain function as identified in the TODO section of the program. This section was implemented the Q-training algorithm for the agent to learn during its operation.


## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists are similar to engineers in the sense that at there heart they are problem solvers. Looking to explore and expand the knowledge base of programming and the areas and concepts that relate to it. They also try to bring this knowledge base to those without the expertise. This is important because the capabilities of computers should not be restricted to certain applications, businesses, or people. By making the product of this knowledge accessible to those outside of the computer science community is the high tide that raises all boats. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by trying to break it down into different aspects. While it is beneficial to understand all facets of the problem in order to know how the pieces should fit together, I believe that by breaking it down, it can be easier to find solutions efficiently. It is also important to factor in the end user of the problem. This can help to give insight on why the problem is important. I also believe it is important to have an iterative approach during this problem solving issue. When there are many facets it can be beneficial to achieve an actionable amount of success in each section so that way the solution develops as a whole, instead of trying to fully work one section before moving to the next. I find that the solution may change as it is developed so the solution previously developed may have to be overhauled. 


## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I believe that my ethical responsibilies to the end user and the organization are fairly straight forward: work on the task at hand as effectively as I am capable of in order to provide the user the best and safest product possible and ask for help if I feel that I am incapabable of accomplishing this by myself.
